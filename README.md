# Identity Verification (Demo)
This is my personal demo of my creation, an identity verification, powered by AWS Rekognition, from scratch.

Everything in this repository is an experiment and its functionality is subject to change, so take at your own risk if you want to try this.

# Agenda
My goal is to replicate identity verification from high-grade platform (such as Veriff, Persona, etc.) just with Amazon Rekognition.

This includes, but not limited to:
- Face ID verification
  - A validation/warning message if the camera is shaky, blurry, or lit in a darken room.
- Take a selfie and holding a government-issued ID

# Installation
Run `pnpm install` to install the modules, then use `pnpm dev` to activate the app in development mode.

It is recommended to use latest version of Node.js (v22.x), Next.js (v15), and pnpm (v10.x)

# Do You Collect My Data?
**I genuinely do not care about your data.**

You can fork this repository, try it yourself, use your own AWS API key, and pay the features by yourself.
